I am currently pursuing **Master's** at [CAU Kiel University](https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/etit/instetit/en?set_language=en), Germany, in [Electrical and Information Technology](https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/etit/instetit/en?set_language=en). 

In my first semester(Winter 2024), I am studying **Advanced Digital Signal Processing**, **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning**, **Optimization and Optimal Control**, and **Essential Numerical Methods**.

I completed my Bachelor's in [Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering](https://heritageit.edu/AEIE.aspx) from [Heritage Institute of Technology](https://heritageit.edu/), India, in 2019.
