Hello, I am a Master's student at [CAU Kiel University](https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/etit/instetit/en?set_language=en), Germany, pursuing [Electrical and Information Technology](https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/etit/instetit/en?set_language=en). 

Along with my studies, I am working as a Research Assistant (HiWi) in the [Bio-Inspired Computation group](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/tf/research/institute-etit/bio-inspired-computation) at CAU Kiel, led by [Prof. Dr. Jan Steinkühler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Dzpoo0AAAAJ&hl=en). My work mainly involves training and developing machine learning and deep learning pipelines for protein yield prediction, and integrating pipetting robots into the workflow for required experiments. 

I completed my Bachelor's in [Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering](https://heritageit.edu/AEIE.aspx) from [Heritage Institute of Technology](https://heritageit.edu/), Kolkata, India, in 2019.
