Hello, I am a Master's student at [CAU Kiel University](https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/etit/instetit/en?set_language=en), Germany, pursuing [Electrical and Information Technology](https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/etit/instetit/en?set_language=en). 

Along with my studies, I am working as a Research Assistant (HiWi) in the [Bio-Inspired Computation group](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/tf/research/institute-etit/bio-inspired-computation) at CAU Kiel, led by [Prof. Dr. Jan Steinkühler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Dzpoo0AAAAJ&hl=en). My work mainly involves training and developing machine learning and deep learning pipelines for protein yield prediction, and integrating pipetting robots into the workflow for required experiments. 

I completed my Bachelor's in [Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering](https://heritageit.edu/AEIE.aspx) from [Heritage Institute of Technology](https://heritageit.edu/), Kolkata, India, in 2019.

## Modules covered so far in my master’s


<!-- - Bio-inspired Information Pathways   -->
<!-- - Channel Coding   -->
- Advanced Digital Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Essential Numerical Methods, Generative AI, 
- Seminar on Generative Artificial Intelligence, Seminar on Information and Coding Theory, Laboratory Real-time Signal Processing
<!-- - Advanced Digital Communications   -->


<!-- - Adaptive Filters   -->


Projects
